# Design Critique Assignment
## Overview
For this design critique, I decided to use this [2020 Census mapper](https://censusmapper.biglocalnews.org/#/) created by Pitch Interactive. It shows the demographic changes in the United States between the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, with a focus on racial composition changes in each region. For reference, here's an image of the basic interface:

## Visualization analysis
### Data
 - This interface uses a combination of geospatial and tabular dataset types. While the geospatial aspect is quite obvious, with the map taking up most of the display, the tabular aspect appears on the side menu and in the tooltips when hovering over a region.
 - As can be inferred from these dataset types, the data types in use for this display are spatial and quantitative. The spatial aspect is seen with the map/regional arrow display, while the quantitative data can be seen in the direction/color of the arrows and the variety of tables visible on the display.
 - The data here was collected from the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census.
### Visual representation
 - The data is represented using a combination of maps and tables. The map is used for a visual display of the changes in racial composition, with each arrow being used to show an area with measurable change. The table is split between different racial groups, with each group having measures in population, the value change, and a percentage.
 - On each area with measured changes for each group, there is an arrow denoting how the population has changed. With all groups selected in the side menu, the arrows on the map show general changes in population. Once different groups are selected, you can see how those specific groups have changed in the makeup of each region.
 - To help communicate this, the arrows use a combination of orientation and color. An arrow pointing more upwards with more green of a color indicates a relative rise of population in that region, while an arrow pointing more downwards with more red of a hue indicates a relative decrease. As these changes become more drastic, the size of the arrows increase. Each of these arrows are positioned at the geographic location of their rise/fall, allowing for an easy glance at how populations have changed from region to region.
 - While not entirely clear, it appears that the visuals appear to scale linearly based on the percentage change. For example, an arrow at 10% seems to be a visual halfway point between the 20% and 0% representations.
### Interactions
 - This interface is extremely interactive. You can toggle different racial groups to display in the side menu, causing the arrows on the map to dynamically alter; tooltips containing local information appear when hovering over a specific region; and clicking a state on the map zooms in on the region and limits the display of data to that specific area.
 - There are components of both external UI and direct manipulation. Directly interacting with the map can be used to limit the visuals, and the side-menu contains an interactive table that can be used to toggle different groups to display.
 - While there don't appear to be any instances of brushing, a zooming lense exists on the map, and the degree of specificity regarding regional breakup (states -> counties -> cities) increases on demand when zooming.
## Purpose
 - The direct intended audience for this display was Stanford University and Google, but it was designed for people of varying degrees of knowledge in social science. All of the terminology used is accessible, standard language, meaning the information display is not limited exclusively to experts in the area, and can be used to answer a variety of questions when it comes to the topic, from general questions about population change to how a specific city's racial makeup has changed in the past decade. For example, while very few regions appear to show growth in all groups consistently, some coastal areas in New Jersey have had notable increases in all racial groups over the past decade.
 - This visualization allows you to view general population trends from region to region in the United States, as well as how specific racial groups have changed proportionately in the United States over the past decade. The varying degrees of specificity allow you to view general trends of states and counties, as well as the differences between specific cities, without any sort of visual conflict.
 - The interactions allow for a much easier viewing of trends in a specific area, as the tooltips allow you to view the different data points that create each arrow, and the zooming allows for a more detailed breakdown in regional changes.
## Critique
 - The arrows on the map are a great medium for getting a quick idea of basic trends, but aren't very useful for specifics, which the tooltips are thankfully there to provide.
 - While the interface becomes much easier to parse as you get used to it, it can be very overwhelming visually at first due to the large amounts of different arrows all over the map. Additionally, the large number of concentrated arrows can make it difficult to work with the tooltips, as they are quite large and can make it difficult to navigate to a specific area.
 - While I do not think this is intentional, there are some aspects of this visualization that appear slightly misleading. For example, my initial response to seeing a larger arrow is that there was a larger change in the actual population size. However, all of the arrow visuals are based solely on relative populaation changes, meaning an increase of 100 people could be as visually distinct as an increase of 10,000 in a denser area.
 - To mitigate these issues, I would suggest making the arrows scale to some degree based on population size changes, rather than with the percentages, as the percentages are already represented by the color/angle. Additionally, I would reduce the number of arrows initially seen on the map to 1/state, and scale their sizes accordingly, and add a toggle for state-by-state arrows or county-by-county arrows to reduce the initial visual overload. This would also help with the tooltip problem, as fewer arrows in the large view of the map make it easier to select regions to view more information on.
